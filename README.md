# 🍕 Pizza Sales SQL Project

Welcome to my Pizza Sales Analysis project! This is a fun SQL project where I explored sales data from a fictional pizza shop to find useful insights.

## 🔍 What I Did
Using SQL, I answered questions like:
- Which pizzas sell the most?
- What times are the busiest?
- How much money are we making?
- Which sizes and categories are most popular?

## 🧰 Tools I Used
- SQL (you can use MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server)
- GitHub (to share everything!)

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- Writing SQL queries for real-world analysis
- Using GROUP BY, JOIN, CTE, and more
- Reading and exploring business data
- Creating simple dashboards (if you want visuals)

## 📁 What's Inside
- `Dataset/` – The pizza sales data (CSV)
- `SQL_Scripts/` – All the SQL queries I wrote
- `Visualizations/` – Optional charts or dashboards
- `README.md` – You’re reading it 🙂

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Load the CSV into your database.
2. Open the SQL file and run each query.
3. Check out the insights or build a dashboard!

Thanks for checking out my project 🙌
